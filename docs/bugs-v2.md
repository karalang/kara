# Bug ledger (v2)

`docs/bugs-v2.jsonl` is the live, machine-countable record of every bug found in
`karac` since M3, when legacy was deleted. One JSON object per line, keyed by a
`B-YYYY-MM-DD-N` id (the day it was found, `N` that day's sequence). Ids continue
the pre-M3 sequence, so an id names exactly one row across this file and the
archive.

The pre-M3 ledger is archived read-only at
[`docs/legacy/bug-ledger.jsonl`](legacy/bug-ledger.jsonl), with its rollup at
[`docs/legacy/bug-ledger.md`](legacy/bug-ledger.md). The rows still open at the
split were carried here verbatim; their archive copies are `relocated` stubs
pointing at this file. A legacy bug that turns out to be live on v2 gets a FRESH
row here citing the archived one.

## The rule

1. Every bug found gets one appended line. Allocate the id as late as possible,
   off a fresh `git fetch`; on a collision, keep both rows and renumber yours.
2. A row carries the countable fields plus `detail`, which holds the
   measurements. `detail` + `fix` stay under 6 KB per row (lint rule 11): put a
   long reproduction in a corpus program and cite it in `corpus`.
3. A kata that surfaces a bug cites its id in its README.
4. Close a row with `scripts/bug-close.py` (its `--expect` assertion is
   mandatory), after the final rebase.
5. `scripts/bug-lint.sh` enforces all of this; run it after the final rebase.

## Schema

| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, the day it was found |
| `source` | `family[:slug]`, family one of kata · kata-gap · kata-gap-audit · selfhost · dogfood · probe · spike · internal · followup · test-infra · example |
| `surface` | typecheck · resolver · parser · lexer · ownership · effect · mir · mir-llvm · interp (the MIR interpreter) · runtime · cli · autopar · other, or a `+`-joined compound |
| `class` | miscompile · double-free · use-after-free · leak · crash · codegen-gap · missing-feature · false-positive · soundness · run-vs-build · diagnostics · perf · other |
| `severity` | high · medium · low |
| `status` | open · fixed · wontfix · relocated · invalid · not-reproduced |
| `fix` | opens with `FIXED by <sha>.` when fixed |
| `title` | one line |
| `tracker` | required for `relocated`: where the work now lives |
| `detail` | measurements, under the 6 KB cap with `fix` |
| `corpus` | optional: the corpus program that reproduces it |

| B-2026-10-24-2 | 2026-10-24 | codegen | low | A long `sort_by` of shuffled pairs on the MIR compiled backend runs 1.5x legacy and about 1.9x Rust after B-2026-10-13-18's partition: kata 252's bench is 0.28-0.30 s against legacy's 0.19 s, and 1,000,000 indices sorted by key 10 times take 0.93-1.05 s against rustc -O's 0.51-0.56 s | — |
| B-2026-10-27-33 | 2026-10-27 | typecheck | medium | A generic function that spawns or sends a value of a type parameter need not require `T: CrossTask`, so a `shared` value enters a task through it: `fn run_all[U](x: own U) -> i64 { let g = TaskGroup.new(); g.spawn(|| { let y = x; 1 }).join() }` passes check and runs with `run_all(Cell { n: 1 })` over a `shared struct Cell`, where design.md § `CrossTask` says such a function "must itself require `T: CrossTask`" and the error is at that generic signature | — |
| B-2026-10-28-1 | 2026-10-28 | mir-llvm | low | After 45524985d1 a one-worker auto-par build runs the in-order build's instructions, yet 16 of 129 M4b programs still time under 0.9x of it in one 9-run pass (kata 7 0.764, 8 0.727, 125 0.696, 153 0.798, 895 0.79, word_freq_multi 0.787): the code is the same and lands elsewhere, so the floor at one worker is at the resolution of code placement | — |
| B-2026-10-28-2 | 2026-10-28 | typecheck | low | A generic struct's or enum's declared parameter bounds are not checked where the type is written with arguments: `struct M[T: Hash + Eq] { m: Map[T, i64] }` lets `fn mk() -> M[f64]` and `let x: M[f64] = mk()` pass, and the `f64` key surfaces only at a later `x.m.len()` (reported twice there); the target is a refusal at the written `M[f64]` naming the unmet bound, for every declared bound, not only `Hash + Eq` | — |
| B-2026-10-28-3 | 2026-10-28 | mir-llvm | low | A compiled program's run time moves 10-20% with where its hot function lands, and the runtime archive is one of the things that moves it: kata 125 runs about 10% slower whenever karac.main sits at 16 mod 64 (the full archive's larger headers shift user code by 0x3130 bytes), kata 28 KMP 0.41 vs 0.52 s between layouts; no alignment setting tried removes the swing without slowing another program 7-20% | — |

### Relocated

<details><summary>Relocated — real and still scheduled, but with no action item today and a concrete external trigger, so the work now lives on a canonical tracker. Not wontfix (that is 'measured to a standstill'); follow the tracker column.</summary>
