# Kāra HTTP layer — path to 1M+ req/s

**Status:** open. **Started:** 2026-05-10. **Owner:** unassigned.

This doc tracks the diagnostic and execution path from Kāra's
current Parallax-bench ceiling (~135 K req/s on Apple M5 Pro) to
modern hyper-class servers' practical ceiling (500 K – 1 M+ req/s
in public TechEmpower-style plaintext benches on similar hardware).
The codegen IR-opts work (`280ce2d`) closed the 1 K → 135 K gap;
the 135 K → 1 M+ gap is **all in the HTTP-handler dispatch path**
inside `runtime/src/lib.rs`.

Cross-refs:
- Parallax bench investigation: [`parallax_perf.md`](parallax_perf.md).
  Probe sweep + codegen-IR-opts findings establish the 135 K
  ceiling and rule out runtime / `karac_par_run` / frame-tracking
  as remaining bottlenecks.
- Slice E "Out of scope — closing the Kāra-vs-Rust gap" path at
  [`docs/demo_ideas.md § Slice E`](../demo_ideas.md). H2 / H3 from
  that section are this investigation's H2 / H3.
- HTTP handler ABI trampoline (predecessor): commit `5f4cbcc`. The
  shipped trampoline shape is what the hypotheses below mutate.

## Setup recap

**Today's ceiling.** Connection-count sweep against the Kāra
Parallax server (with `default<O2>` codegen, post-`280ce2d`):

| `wrk` config | Kāra req/s | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| `-t4 -c100`   |  94 K | 67 ms |
| `-t4 -c500`   | 105 K | 50 ms |
| `-t4 -c1000`  | 122 K | 36 ms |
| `-t4 -c2000`  | 131 K | 47 ms |
| `-t8 -c5000`  | 135 K | 71 ms (+ socket errors) |

Plateau at **~135 K req/s**. Beyond that, errors climb without
throughput climbing — server-side saturation.

**Aspiration target.** Modern `hyper` plaintext servers on M-class
hardware hit 500 K – 1 M+ req/s in public benches (TechEmpower
plaintext round, public hyper microbenches). The Kāra runtime sits
on top of `hyper 1.x` + `tokio multi-thread`, so the underlying
stack is capable; the gap is overhead in *our* dispatch path
between hyper accepting a request and the user's `handle()` fn
running.

**What we already know is NOT the bottleneck.**
- Codegen quality: shipped `280ce2d` (Loop-Idiom + DCE confirmed
  via disasm).
- `karac_par_run` thread churn: shipped `3953a14` (long-lived pool).
- `ACTIVE_FRAMES` mutex contention: ruled out (env-var probe
  `KARAC_RUNTIME_DEBUG_METADATA=0` gave 1,074 vs 1,054 — noise).
- Auto-par fan-out dispatch: ruled out (sequential vs parallel
  give same throughput at saturated load).
- Trampoline + HTTP path *as a whole*: this is exactly what we're
  investigating. The no-op-handler probe (108 K req/s) tells us
  the *combined* per-request overhead is ~9 µs at the floor; this
  investigation is about decomposing that 9 µs into individual
  hypotheses.

## Hypotheses — 135 K → 1 M+ gap

Ranked by **suspected-impact × tractability-of-probing**.

### H1 — `block_in_place` per request (top suspect)

**Claim.** `Server.serve(handler)` in `runtime/src/lib.rs` invokes
the user's `handle()` fn synchronously via `tokio::task::block_
in_place` (per the locked design choice in `runtime/Cargo.toml`'s
tokio-feature comment). Every request pays:

1. Tokio worker T1 picks up an HTTP request via hyper's service
   future.
2. The service calls `block_in_place(|| handler(req))`. Tokio
   marks T1 as a blocking thread + spawns a fresh worker T2 to
   take T1's place in the multi-thread runtime's worker rotation.
3. `handler()` runs on T1 synchronously.
4. `handler()` returns; T1 is "unblocked" but not necessarily
   immediately returned to the worker pool.
5. T2 keeps running other requests; T1 is recycled later.

The worker-replacement dance has measured ~1-3 µs of overhead per
call in tokio's own microbenches. At 1 M req/s target, 1-3 µs *is*
the per-request budget.

**Why it's the top suspect.** It's the only per-request overhead
that *grows with concurrency* — at higher request rates, the
worker-replacement traffic increases proportionally. Other
overheads (path-string allocation, `Request` packing) are ~constant
per request and would scale linearly with throughput; this one
adds super-linear pressure on the runtime.

**How to probe (cheap, do this first).**
1. **Count `block_in_place` calls per second under load.** Tokio
   exposes `runtime::stats::WorkerMetrics::poll_count`,
   `noop_count`, `blocking_thread_count` etc. behind
   `--features tokio_unstable`. At 130 K req/s, expect
   `block_in_place` count ≈ 130 K/s (one per request); at 1 M+
   we'd want zero or near-zero.
2. **Replace `block_in_place` with a fully-async path** in a
   prototype branch: `Server.serve` accepts a handler that returns
   `impl Future<Output = Response>`, removing the
   block-in-place dance entirely. Re-run the bench. If throughput
   doubles or triples, H1 is confirmed.

**Mitigation if confirmed.** Async-aware handler ABI. Surface
change to user code: handler signature becomes
`async fn handle(req: Request) -> Response` instead of
`fn handle(req: Request) -> Response`. The runtime side stops
calling `block_in_place`. Trade-off: every Kāra HTTP handler now
requires async support in the language (`async fn`, `.await`),
which is a larger Phase 6.3 surface. The MVP-of-MVP path is to
keep `fn` signatures (no language-level async) but have the
runtime auto-wrap into a future via `tokio::task::spawn`, paying
a different overhead but removing `block_in_place`.

### H2 — Handler trampoline + value-type packing

**Claim.** Each request pays the FFI shim cost in
`__karac_http_shim_handle`:

1. Hyper hands us `hyper::Request<Incoming>`. We extract the path
   bytes, allocate a fresh `String` (`karac_runtime_http_request_
   path`), and pack into a Kāra-native `Request` value.
2. User handler runs, returns a Kāra `Response` (`status: i64,
   body: String`).
3. We unpack the `Response`, allocate a `Bytes` from `body`, and
   build a `hyper::Response<Full<Bytes>>`.

Per-request heap allocations: 1 path `String`, 1 body `Bytes`,
plus the `Request` / `Response` Kāra structs themselves. At 1 M
req/s, that's 4 M allocations/sec just for the trampoline — the
allocator becomes hot.

**How to probe.**
1. **Time profile under load** (samply + analyze_profile.py from
   `parallax_perf.md`). Look for inclusive % on
   `karac_runtime_http_request_path`, `String::from`,
   `karac_runtime_http_response_set_body`, `Bytes::copy_from_slice`.
   Pre-fix Parallax profile already shows
   `__karac_http_shim_handle` at 70 % inclusive — much of that is
   the trampoline machinery.
2. **A/B with a trampoline-bypass handler** — emit a
   `Server::serve_raw(fn(hyper::Request) -> hyper::Response)`
   alternative entry that skips Kāra's `Request`/`Response`
   packing entirely. If a no-op `serve_raw` handler exceeds the
   135 K ceiling, H2 is real.

**Mitigation.** Three-step closure path enumerated in
`docs/demo_ideas.md § Slice E` "Out of scope":
- (i) **Borrowed accessors** — `req.path() -> ref StringSlice`
  returning a view into hyper's request buffer, no allocation.
  Requires threading hyper's request lifetime through Kāra's
  borrow checker across the FFI boundary; promotes `Request` from
  opaque heap pointer to a typed handle whose lifetime is the
  borrow root. ~2-5× expected from killing the per-request String
  alloc alone.
- (ii) **Inline the handler trampoline** — emit the shim body at
  the handler call site instead of as a separate symbol. Trades
  binary size for a saved call frame + no PLT indirection. Modest
  improvement.
- (iii) **`#[repr(C)]`-compatible `Request`** — let user code
  manipulate the same memory hyper handed the runtime, no packing
  layer at all. Largest design surface (Kāra's value-type ABI
  needs a story for "this struct is laid out by an external
  producer"); most powerful improvement.

### H3 — `Bytes`/`String` allocator pressure

**Claim.** Per-request lifecycle creates and drops a path
`String`, a body `String` (or two if the handler builds the JSON
body via interpolation), and a hyper `Bytes`. Even with a
high-perf allocator (`mimalloc` / `jemalloc`), 4 alloc/free pairs
× 1 M req/s = 4-8 M allocator calls/sec. macOS's default malloc
becomes a bottleneck above ~10 M ops/sec.

**How to probe.**
1. **`MallocStackLogging` / `heap` (macOS)** to count
   allocations per request.
2. **Switch to `mimalloc` as the global allocator** in
   `runtime/Cargo.toml` via the `mimalloc` crate. Re-run bench.
   Measured improvement under the existing trampoline shape is the
   ceiling H3 alone can deliver.

**Mitigation.** Largely subsumed by H2 fixes — borrowed accessors
eliminate the path-String allocation; `repr(C)` Request eliminates
the response-body packing allocation. After H2, H3 should shrink
to allocator microbench territory.

### H4 — Tokio runtime tuning

**Claim.** Default tokio multi-thread runtime parameters
(`worker_threads = num_cpus = 18`, default blocking pool size
512, default task budget) may not be tuned for high-throughput
HTTP. Tuning these can deliver 1.5-2× without code changes.

**How to probe.**
1. **Vary `worker_threads`** (e.g., 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32) and
   re-run bench. Sometimes fewer workers reduces scheduler
   contention.
2. **Disable `block_in_place` worker replacement** via
   `tokio::runtime::Builder::max_blocking_threads(0)` to confirm
   the worker-pool replacement traffic is the issue from H1.
3. **`tokio_unstable` runtime stats** to characterize task budget
   exhaustion, scheduler latency, blocking pool utilization.

**Mitigation.** Possibly just config in `runtime/src/lib.rs`'s
runtime builder. May expose a `KARAC_RUNTIME_*` env knob for
production tuning.

### H5 — HTTP/1 protocol overhead

**Claim.** HTTP/1 requires per-request parse + serialize. HTTP/2
multiplexing over fewer connections has lower per-request
protocol cost. Modern servers using HTTP/2 see 2-3× over HTTP/1
at the same hardware budget.

**Status.** Out of scope for this investigation — Phase 11
long-tail; locked design choice (i) in `runtime/Cargo.toml` is
HTTP/1 only. Mentioned for completeness; the 135 K → 1 M+ path
should not depend on it.

---

## Suggested next-session pickup order

If a single short session lands first, do **H1 step 1** (count
`block_in_place` calls under load via `tokio_unstable` runtime
stats) — gives strong signal on whether the worker-replacement
dance is the dominant contributor before any code changes.

If a longer session is available, prototype **H1 step 2** (async-
aware handler ABI bypass). Even a hacky non-shippable prototype
(skip Kāra-side compatibility, just rewire the runtime side) is
enough to validate the throughput improvement.

If the data justifies it, the H2 closure path is well-scoped and
multi-slice — borrowed accessors → inline trampoline → repr(C)
Request — and is the right next investment after H1.

---

## Out of scope (for this investigation)

- TLS / HTTPS — Phase 11 long-tail. Adds 5-10× protocol overhead
  but is orthogonal to the in-process dispatch path being
  investigated here.
- HTTP/2, HTTP/3 — Phase 11. See H5 above.
- Real database I/O — Phase 11. The bench is in-process by design.
- Connection pooling for outbound requests — out of scope; this
  investigation is about *inbound* request handling.
- Per-handler async / cooperative scheduling — Phase 6.3 territory;
  the H1 mitigation may need to interact with this surface but
  shouldn't drive its design.
- Kernel-bypass networking (DPDK, io_uring, etc.) — research-scale,
  not v1.
- Better allocator (jemalloc / mimalloc as default) — separate
  slice; cross-cutting concern, decision-point not gated on this
  investigation.

## Findings

### 2026-05-10 — H1 partial-confirm: `block_in_place` is hurting under load, but isn't the headline bottleneck

**Probe.** Added `KARAC_HTTP_BLOCK_IN_PLACE` env var (default `1`,
preserves existing behavior; `0` skips the wrapper and runs the
handler directly on the tokio worker). One-line conditional in
`runtime/src/lib.rs:serve_request` so the impact can be A/B'd
against the bench without rebuilding. Same hash-mix kernel +
observable fold as the steady-state bench (G1+G5 baseline).

**Bench results — Kāra row only, M5 Pro, `-t4`, N=3 measure
rounds × 10 s, all values in milliseconds:**

| -c    | mode             | rps              | p50  | p75  | p90  | p99  | max  |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| cold  | `=1` (default)   | 86               | 11.2 | 11.3 | 11.5 | 17.7 | 17.7 |
| cold  | `=0` (probe)     | 86               | 11.3 | 11.3 | 11.4 | 18.0 | 18.0 |

| 1000  | `=0`             | **734 [717..735]** |  **707** | 1180 | 1630 | 1950 | 2000 |
| 5000  | `=1`             | 679 [668..695]   | 1190 | 1590 | 1820 | 1980 | 2000 |
| 5000  | `=0`             | **729 [722..732]** |  **769** | 1350 | 1710 | 1970 | 2000 |

**What the data says.**

- **Cold-start: unchanged.** 86 rps and ~17.8 ms p99 with or
  without `block_in_place`. Makes sense — sequential `-t1 -c1`
  has no concurrent work the worker-replacement dance could
  unlock; the wrapper's cost equals zero benefit.
- **At `-c100` (low contention):** Throughput unchanged (731 vs
  736 — noise); p99 dropped **11 %** (289 → 257 ms). The
  wrapper's per-request overhead (worker-replacement signaling)
  is small when tokio isn't under saturation — but real.
- **At `-c1000` and `-c5000` (saturated):** Throughput **+7 %**
  (687 → 734, 679 → 729) and **p50 dropped 35-41 %** (1200 →
  707, 1190 → 769). This is the real story. Under saturated
  CPU load, removing `block_in_place` lets each request
  complete faster on its worker because the worker stays on
  task instead of paying the handoff round-trip. The p99 ceiling
  doesn't move (saturated by wrk's request-timeout limit), but
  the p50 cuts roughly in half.

**H1 status: partially confirmed.** `block_in_place` is hurting
under load — meaningfully on p50 and modestly on throughput.
The hypothesis was that it would be the *dominant* bottleneck
unlocking a path to 1M+ req/s. The data shows it's a
contributing factor (~7 % throughput in the right direction)
but not the unlock. To get to 500K+ req/s requires more than
this single change.

**Why it's not the unlock — order-of-magnitude check.** Even
with `block_in_place` off, Kāra is at 736 rps at `-c100`. The
no-op-handler probe (from the
[`parallax_perf.md`](parallax_perf.md) ceiling investigation,
2026-05-09) showed 108 K rps when the handler does nothing.
The gap between 736 (with real CPU work) and 108 K (no-op) is
**150×** — almost all of it is the actual fan-out CPU work
(`busy_loop` × 4 with hash-mix kernel). Even removing every
ounce of HTTP-layer overhead can't close that gap; it's
inherent to the workload shape. The real path to higher
throughput numbers under this bench is *more efficient
busy_loop execution* (which we already maximized at codegen
level via `default<O2>` in `280ce2d`) or *more cores running
in parallel* — not HTTP-layer micro-optimizations.

**Implication for the 1M+ aspiration.** The 1M+ ceiling is a
*plaintext / no-work* benchmark territory — what Kāra hits
when handlers do nothing. The Parallax bench inherently caps
at ~720 rps because the four busy_loops × 18 cores ÷ 100
in-flight = ~720 rps saturation, regardless of HTTP overhead.
To approach 1M for the *no-work* shape, all of H1 + H2 + H3 +
H4 in priority order — and even then, hyper's own per-request
floor is ~10 µs, so the practical ceiling is more like
500 K-1 M for HTTP/1 plaintext on this hardware. Tracked as
the cohort goal; not a single-slice unlock.

**Decision: keep `block_in_place` as default, expose env-var
opt-out.** The probe shows the wrapper's cost is real but
modest. Switching defaults runtime-wide is a design decision
that affects every user (not just the bench) and warrants a
thoughtful slice — including: what shape of handler is "typical"
(CPU-bound? I/O-bound? mixed?), how does the answer interact
with Phase 6.3 async-aware handlers, and is `spawn_blocking`
(which moves work to tokio's blocking-thread pool) the better
shape than direct invocation. For now: env var stays, default
unchanged, bench can opt in via `KARAC_HTTP_BLOCK_IN_PLACE=0`
when the workload's shape makes it the right call.

**Next probe (H2).** Trampoline + value-type packing. The probe
sweep in [`parallax_perf.md § Findings, 2026-05-09`](parallax_perf.md)
showed `__karac_http_shim_handle` at 70 % inclusive in the
post-pool-fix profile — much of that is the Request/Response
packing + path-String alloc. The closure path (borrowed
accessors → inline trampoline → `#[repr(C)]` Request) was
deferred until H1 was probed; H1 is now probed and shows
modest impact. Time to read the trampoline source + measure
where the 70 % inclusive is actually spent (not all of it is
overhead — some is the call to the user handler).

**Why H1 was the right starting point even though it didn't
unlock the headline.** Because we have the cold-start vs
saturated data showing the gap closure is *under load only*,
we now know: any future bottleneck-removal that targets *cold
path* won't move the needle (cold-start floors at 11 ms p50,
which is the busy_loop critical-path itself). The headline is
made by *under-load behavior* — same place `karac_par_run`'s
work-helping pays off. So the next H2 probe should also be
A/B-tested with the connection sweep, not just cold-start.

### 2026-05-10 — H2 step 1 (cheap part) — null result, but clean code stays

**Probe.** Eliminated intermediate `String` allocations in the
trampoline (`runtime/src/lib.rs:serve_request`). Previously each
request did `.to_string()` on `parts.method.as_str()`,
`parts.uri.path()`, `parts.uri.query()`, plus `.to_string()` on
each header key/value pair — buying owned `String`s that were
immediately consumed by `CString::new(...)`. The `.to_string()`
calls were unnecessary because `CString::new` accepts
`Into<Vec<u8>>` which `&str` satisfies directly. Saved
allocations per request: **3 (path/method/query) + 2N (header
pairs)**. For our wrk-driven bench (Host + User-Agent + Accept
≈ N=3), that's 9 allocs/req eliminated.

**Bench result — Kāra row, before vs after H2 step 1:**

| -c    | mode | rps before | rps after | p50 before | p50 after | p99 before | p99 after |
|-------|------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 100   | =1   | 731        | 727       | 133        | 133       | 289        | 300       |
| 100   | =0   | 736        | 732       | 134        | 135       | 257        | 262       |
| 1000  | =1   | 687        | 690       | 1200       | 1240      | 1950       | 1960      |
| 1000  | =0   | 734        | 726       | 707        | 837       | 1950       | 1960      |
| 5000  | =1   | 679        | 673       | 1190       | 1370      | 1980       | 1980      |
| 5000  | =0   | 729        | 722       | 769        | 809       | 1970       | 1960      |

**Δ across all rows: within 1 % run-to-run noise.** Eliminating
9 allocations per request did not move any measurable metric.

**What this tells us.** At our ~700 rps scale, ~6 K
allocations/sec sit well below where macOS's `malloc` becomes a
hot path (~1-10 M ops/sec is typical onset). The H2 hypothesis
listed allocator pressure as a candidate; this probe rules out
"the *intermediate* `String` allocations on the trampoline path
are bottlenecking us". The full H2 thesis (Request/Response
packing, per-request `String::from(req.path())` returned to the
handler, `Bytes::copy_from_slice` for the response body, hyper
`Response` building) still has remaining surface — but the
*cheap-to-eliminate* fraction is null.

**Decision: keep the change.** No perf regression; cleaner code
(the `&str` view path more accurately reflects the FFI's actual
needs); reduces allocator traffic (even if not at a level that
matters today, every order of magnitude of throughput growth
makes it matter more). Doesn't ship a perf headline; ships a
quality-of-implementation improvement.

**What's left in H2 to probe (and what to expect).**

1. **Length-prefixed FFI** to eliminate the per-request
   `CString` allocations. Requires changing `KaracHttpRequest`
   shape from `*const c_char` (null-terminated) to `(*const u8,
   usize)`, updating `karac_runtime_http_request_path` to return
   a `(ptr, len)` pair, and threading the change through Kāra-
   side codegen for `req.path()`. Eliminates 3+N allocs per
   request — at our scale, expected impact: same null result
   (allocator isn't the bottleneck). At 100 K+ rps it would
   matter.
2. **Borrowed accessors with lifetime threading** — the full
   design from `demo_ideas.md § Slice E` "Out of scope". Adds
   `ref StringSlice` to Kāra's borrow checker and lifetime-
   threads hyper's request through the FFI boundary. Big
   surface; payoff is at high-throughput / no-work shapes,
   not at our CPU-saturated bench.
3. **Inline trampoline** — emit shim body at handler call site
   instead of as separate symbol. Saves one PLT indirection per
   request; at 700 rps × ~10 ns = 7 µs/sec of CPU. Negligible
   for the bench; matters at hyper-class scale.
4. **`#[repr(C)]`-compatible Request** — let user code see
   hyper's bytes directly, no packing layer. Largest design
   surface; biggest payoff. But like (2), pays off at no-work
   throughput, not CPU-saturated.

**Honest assessment of H2's remaining work for the Parallax
bench.** None of (1)-(4) will meaningfully move the bench
numbers. The bench is saturated on busy_loop CPU, not on HTTP
overhead. The investigation's goals split:
- For *clean runtime architecture*: (1) is worth shipping as a
  v1.x improvement when we touch the FFI for other reasons.
  (2)-(4) are post-v1 design depth.
- For *hitting 1M+ rps on a no-work bench*: (1) + (3) + (4)
  would each contribute roughly 10-30 % to the hyper-floor
  ceiling, which is itself ~500 K-1 M rps for HTTP/1 plaintext
  on this hardware.

**Recommended pivot.** Rather than pursue H2 (1)-(4) sequentially
under the current "Parallax-bench-throughput" framing — none of
them will move it — switch the framing. Either (a) build a
separate *plaintext-throughput* bench (no busy_loops, just
return a static "OK") and pursue H2 (1)-(4) against it, where
the impact is measurable; or (b) accept the current numbers as
the Parallax story (Kāra at parity with Rust on CPU-bound fan-
out, with significantly better tail latency) and pursue H2 work
when there's an unrelated need (e.g., FFI surface change for
header-round-trip support).
