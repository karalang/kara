# Implementation Checklist

Items to validate, benchmark, or revisit during specific implementation phases. These are not design decisions — they are implementation concerns that should not be forgotten.

Sourced from open gaps identified during design review that don't require design decisions but do require action during implementation.

## Work in Progress (updated 2026-05-04)
