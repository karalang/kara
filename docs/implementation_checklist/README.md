# Implementation Checklist

Items to validate, benchmark, or revisit during specific implementation phases. These are not design decisions — they are implementation concerns that should not be forgotten.

Sourced from open gaps identified during design review that don't require design decisions but do require action during implementation.

Status-marker convention (including the `[->]` "explicitly deferred" state) is documented in [Tracker status markers](#tracker-status-markers) below.

## Tracker status markers

The phase trackers in this directory use four checkbox states. The fourth — `[->]` — is specifically about intra-epic deferrals (a slice acknowledged-but-skipped within an otherwise shipping epic).

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Not yet started. |
| `[~]` | Partially shipped — one or more slices done, others still open and scheduled. |
| `[x]` | Fully shipped. |
| `[->]` | Explicitly deferred. The body must record the **reason** and the **reopen condition** (a concrete trigger that flips the entry back to `[~]`). Greppable as `\[->\]` for ledger sweeps. |

`[x]` and `[->]` are both "no further work scheduled today"; the difference is whether the rest of the item is *done* or *acknowledged-but-skipped*. Use `[->]` when shipping the placeholder annotation would be busywork without a real motivating signal — it preserves the decision so a future reader doesn't mistake the gap for forgotten scope. `[~]` is reserved for work actively in flight or with an identified next step; once that step is "wait for an external trigger," the marker should flip to `[->]`.

## Work in Progress (updated 2026-05-04)

WIP entries live in two trackers, split by lane so List-1 and List-2 work
can be edited and committed independently without merge conflicts.

- **[`wip-list1.md`](wip-list1.md)** — serial work (one agent at a time
  owns the in-flight bullet). Currently empty.
- **`wip-list2.md`** — parallel-safe work (any agent can pick up without
  coordination; file / function boundaries are chosen so the work doesn't
  conflict with the active List-1 bullet). Created on demand.

Each file's bullets get migrated into the relevant `phase-N-*.md` tracker
when work begins; the tracker is checked off in both places as work
progresses, and the WIP file's body is cleared once its bullets all close
(the file itself is kept as a scaffold for the next theme).
