/// Policy for effect declarations on public functions.
///
/// Mirrors the `public_effects` knob in `kara.toml`:
/// - `Declared` (default): every `pub fn` must declare its effects; the
///   compiler verifies the declaration matches the inferred set.
/// - `Inferred`: `pub fn` effects may be left undeclared and are inferred
///   from the body (same treatment as private functions). If a `pub fn`
///   does write an explicit `with ...` clause, it is still verified —
///   writing the declaration is an implicit per-function opt-in. This
///   mode targets prototyping and application crates where the stability
///   contract of declared effects isn't worth the annotation cost.
///
/// Does not affect private-function inference or trait method policy —
/// trait method rules are specified separately in `docs/design.md`
/// § Trait Coherence and Effects.
