//! Control-flow graph construction for Kāra function bodies.
//!
//! Per design.md § Part 4 RC Dataflow Specification: the RC fallback pass
//! requires a structured CFG with a dominator tree. This module lowers a
//! function body's AST into a basic-block CFG, recording the use-sites
//! (read or consume) of each binding within each block.
//!
//! Kāra has no `goto`; every control-flow construct (`if`, `match`,
//! `while`, `for`, `loop`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, `?`) lowers to
//! a structured, reducible CFG. The graph this module produces is the
//! input to:
//!  - the dominator tree pass (`src/dominator.rs`), and
//!  - the formal RC-condition check `∃C∃U with U ≠ C, ¬dom(C,U) ∧ ¬dom(U,C)`
//!    that replaces the linear forward state machine in `src/ownership.rs`.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Round 12.7 ships the foundational CFG builder with use-site collection,
//! exercised in unit tests. Integration into `ownership.rs` is staged in a
//! subsequent round — the existing linear forward state machine continues
//! to drive RC fallback decisions until the new pass is wired through.
