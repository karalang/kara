//! Closure-escape ref-capture detection (round 12.35 — Closure

//!
//! Houses `check_closure_ref_capture_escapes` (the per-function
//! entry) and the read-only walker family that powers it:
//!
//! - `collect_closure_let_bindings` /
//!   `collect_closure_let_bindings_in_expr` — build the
//!   `binding name → closure span` map for closures stored in
//!   single-name let bindings.
//! - `collect_escaping_closures` /
//!   `collect_escaping_closures_in_expr` /
//!   `collect_escape_target` — find every `return Some(closure_or_ident)`
//!   site (and the tail-expression form) that escapes a closure
//!   past the current function's frame.
//! - `fn_allows_ref_capture_escape` — opt-in attribute check.
//! - `collect_call_arg_escape_closures` — recognize closures passed
//!   as call args where the callee declares an escape contract.
//! - `walk_block_for_calls` / `walk_stmt_for_calls` /
//!   `walk_expr_for_calls` — generic call-site visitor used by the
//!   above to thread a `FnMut(&Expr, &[CallArg])` over the body.
