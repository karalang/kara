//! Line-based REPL over the tree-walk interpreter.
//!
//! Implements `karac repl` (P0 delivery item per `roadmap.md § Interactive
//! Development`). Each cell is wrapped as the body of an implicit
//! `fn main()` per `design.md § Interactive Evaluation Model > Cell Scope`,
//! with top-level items (fn / struct / enum / trait / impl / const)
//! accumulating across the session.
//!
//! Surface (v1 MVP):
//! - Read-eval-print loop with multi-line continuation (brace-balance probe).
//! - Persistent top-level items across cells.
//! - Meta-commands: `:help`, `:quit`, `:type <expr>`, `:effects`, `:save <file>`.
//! - Last expression in a cell auto-prints if it's not `Unit`.
//!
//! Persistent `let` bindings (v1 source-replay model):
//! - Top-level `let` / `let mut` statements from a successfully-evaluated
//!   statement cell are extracted (verbatim source) and prepended to every
//!   subsequent synthetic `fn main()` body. A later cell that references
//!   `x` resolves it against the replayed `let x = ...;` from cell N.
//! - Caveat: side effects on the RHS re-run on every cell (the value is
//!   recomputed, not snapshotted). Pure literal / arithmetic bindings
//!   behave like a notebook; `let x = read_file(...)` re-reads the file.
//!   Full value-snapshot semantics ship with the Jupyter kernel CR
//!   (interpreter surgery scheduled separately).
//! - `:reset` clears the persistent-let buffer for users who want to
//!   recover from an expensive replay.
//!
//! Other v1 limitations (called out in `:help`):
//! - Mutation in a statement cell (`x += 1;`) does not survive to the
//!   next cell — only `let` source replays. Re-binding (`let x = x + 1;`)
//!   is the supported idiom for now.
//! - `--auto-clone`, notebook-aware use-after-move hints, and rich Jupyter
//!   display all ship as separate items in the Interactive Development
//!   chapter of `roadmap.md`.
