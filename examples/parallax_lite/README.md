# Parallax-lite

First demo-shaped consumer of the Kāra auto-concurrency codegen track
(slices 1 + 2 of the Debugger Contract phase). A compact, self-contained
Kāra workload that exercises auto-par lowering on three independent
effect-annotated calls and pins the IR shape, the analyzer's grouping
decision, and the cost-summary surface against regressions.

## What it demonstrates

`workload.kara::process_request` is three top-level call statements,
each carrying a distinct `writes(R_i)` effect on a disjoint resource:

```kara
pub fn process_request() with writes(MetricsA) writes(MetricsB) writes(MetricsC) {
    record_a();
    record_b();
    record_c();
}
```

The analyzer (`src/concurrency.rs`) sees no conflict edges between the
three statements (`writes(MetricsA)` vs `writes(MetricsB)` is safe — the
conflict table only triggers on same-resource, same-category pairs), so
it groups all three into a single `parallel_group`. The codegen path
(`compile_function_body` in `src/codegen.rs`) sees a non-trivial group
(non-empty effect set), no binding-leak (no `let` introduced in the
group), and dispatches the trio through a single `karac_par_run` call
that fans out three branch fns to the runtime's worker pool.

End result: `process_request` runs three CPU-bound branches concurrently
without any explicit `par {}` block in the source — the auto-par codegen
infers the parallel structure purely from effect annotations.

## The demo-shape gap

The canonical Parallax demo (per `docs/dogfooding.md § Demo 1`) is
*fan-out + join* — multiple parallel reads whose results are joined
into a result struct (`build_dashboard(profile, orders, notif,
recommended)`). Slice 2's `group_defines_binding_used_outside` gate
blocks that exact pattern today: bindings introduced inside a parallel
group that are read by statements *outside* the group cannot
auto-parallelize, because `karac_par_run`'s branch fns capture *into*
their env struct but do not propagate let-bindings *out*.

Lifting the gate requires the still-open
`docs/implementation_checklist/phase-7-codegen.md:182` entry **"Par
codegen: return values"**, which extends the runtime ABI with per-branch
return slots. Until that lands, Parallax-lite ships *effect-only
fan-out* — three independent calls with no joined return — as the v1
auto-par measurement workload. The canonical fan-out + join demo lights
up additively when the return-values entry lands, with no source change
to slice 6's workload required (the analyzer already grouped that
pattern correctly; only the codegen is gappy).

## How to run

The example uses the multi-file project shape (`kara.toml` + `src/*.kara`).
v1 project-mode build (`karac build` from inside `examples/parallax_lite/`)
runs the multi-file pipeline through cross-module typechecking; full
codegen across modules is a CR-24 follow-up. To exercise the auto-par
path end-to-end today, concatenate the workload into a single file and
build it with `karac build <path>.kara`:

```sh
# concat the canonical workload + a tiny main into a single .kara file
cat examples/parallax_lite/src/resources.kara                                 \
    <(grep -v '^import ' examples/parallax_lite/src/workload.kara)            \
    <(echo 'fn main() { process_request(); println("done"); }')               \
  > /tmp/parallax_lite.kara

# auto-par on (default)
karac build /tmp/parallax_lite.kara
./parallax_lite

# sequential baseline (the slice 6 codegen gate)
KARAC_AUTO_PAR=0 karac build /tmp/parallax_lite.kara
./parallax_lite
```

The `KARAC_AUTO_PAR=0` env var flips the slice 6 codegen gate in
`src/codegen.rs` (`Codegen::auto_par_disabled`), short-circuiting all
parallel-group dispatch back to plain sequential `compile_block`
without changing the source. Default is auto-par on; the user-facing
`--sequential` CLI flag is a Phase 8.5 Track 2 deliverable when the
profile system ships (slice 6 stays inside the codegen entry-point
arg budget — adding a CLI flag would push `compile_to_object_with_options`
past 6 positional args, the slice 3 deviation threshold).

## Wall-clock measurement (locally observed)

Three CPU-bound branches across at least two cores should clear ~1.5x
speedup; perfect 3x is the target with three available cores and zero
overhead. Locally measured on a typical laptop after warmup:

| Mode       | Wall-clock | CPU usage |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Auto-par   | ~0.087s    | ~292%     |
| Sequential | ~0.244s    | ~99%      |
| **Speedup**| **~2.81x** | —         |

The 2.81x ratio sits in the upper quartile of the expected band — the
auto-par mechanism is working as designed. A regression below ~1.5x
would be signal for v1.x cost-model tuning (per-call cost heuristic,
fork threshold, loop-body parallelization rule); below ~1.3x would
suggest thread-spawn / RC-fallback / env-struct-alloc overhead is
dominating and the cost model needs a rebalance. The wall-clock test
in `tests/parallax_lite.rs` is `#[ignore]`-gated (single-run timing
is too flaky for default CI) and asserts a relaxed 1.3x threshold.


## Multicore scaling (18-core machine ground-truth, 2026-05-08)

Synthesized variants of the workload with N=3..24 effect-disjoint
branches were generated, compiled (auto-par on / off via the slice-6
`KARAC_AUTO_PAR=0` codegen-time gate), and benchmarked best-of-5 on an
18-core development machine. The data is the first end-to-end
validation that auto-par delivers near-linear scaling to the core-count
ceiling on commodity hardware:

| N branches | auto-par (s) | sequential (s) | speedup  | scaling efficiency |
|------------|--------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|
| 3          | 0.08         | 0.24           | 3.00x    | 100%               |
| 6          | 0.08         | 0.49           | 6.12x    | ~102% (variance)   |
| 9          | 0.08         | 0.73           | 9.12x    | ~101% (variance)   |
| 12         | 0.09         | 0.95           | 10.55x   | 88%                |
| 18         | 0.09         | 1.43           | **15.88x** | 88%              |
| 24         | 0.17         | 1.97           | 11.58x   | 48% (oversub.)     |

**Three findings.**

1. **15.88x speedup at N=18 on the 18-core machine** — just under 90%
   scaling efficiency at the core-count sweet spot. The "missing" ~2.1x
   is thread-spawn overhead, OS scheduling, branch start/end
   synchronization. First end-to-end validation that auto-par delivers
   on multicore hardware.

2. **Auto-par wall-clock is essentially flat from N=3 to N=18**
   (0.08s → 0.09s). The runtime adds **negligible per-branch overhead**
   as long as `branch_count ≤ available_parallelism()`. Slice 4's
   `Mutex<Vec<FramePtr>>` registry — 1 push + 1 retain per spawn —
   doesn't bottleneck even at 18 concurrent active frames. Validates
   the slice 4 design choice of `Mutex<Vec>` over
   `RwLock<HashMap<ThreadId, _>>` empirically.

3. **Sharp oversubscription cliff at N=24**. Wall-clock jumps from
   0.09s → 0.17s; speedup drops from 15.88x → 11.58x. The runtime spawns
   one OS thread per branch up to `available_parallelism()`, and beyond
   that the OS has to time-slice software threads onto fewer hardware
   cores. Per-branch latency increases. **Actionable signal for v1.x
   cost-model tuning**: the natural fork threshold is
   `branch_count ≤ available_parallelism()`; beyond that, either
   work-stealing or branch-batching is needed.

**Sequential wall-clock scales linearly** at ~80ms per branch
(`sequential_time ≈ 0.08 × N` matches observed). The single-branch
busy-compute kernel is consistent across N. The N=6/9 superlinear
speedup is best-of-5 sequential variance — auto-par numbers are
rock-solid.

**How this data was collected.** `/tmp/scale_test/gen.sh` synthesizes
single-file workloads with N independent `effect resource R_i;` + N
busy-compute drivers + an aggregator. `bench.sh` builds each twice
(default + `KARAC_AUTO_PAR=0` for sequential), runs best-of-5, computes
speedup. Reproducible on any machine; the 15.88x peak depends on
core count.


### High-N stress test (N=50..500)

Pushing further: synthesized variants with N=50, 100, 200, 500 effect-disjoint
branches on the same 18-core machine. The runtime caps worker threads at
`available_parallelism()`, so beyond N=18 each worker handles
`ceil(N / 18)` branches sequentially via the `next_idx.fetch_add` work-stealing
counter. Best-of-1 timing (variance is small at high N):

| N    | auto-par (s) | sequential (s) | speedup  | efficiency |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| 50   | 0.60         | 4.31           | 7.18x    | 43%        |
| 100  | 0.78         | 8.21           | 10.52x   | 63%        |
| 200  | 1.30         | 16.24          | 12.49x   | 75%        |
| 500  | 2.77         | 41.01          | 14.80x   | 83%        |

**Compile time scales linearly.** N=500 compiles in 0.26s (auto-par) /
0.15s (sequential). Per-branch compile cost is ~0.5ms. **No quadratic-time
analyzer pass** — v1.x compiler perf can rely on this; the conflict-matrix
construction in `concurrency.rs` and effect-set unification in
`effectchecker.rs` both stay O(N) or near-linear at 500-element scale.

**Speedup recovers at high N.** At N=500, efficiency rises to 83% (vs 43% at
N=50). Verified by an N=50 variant with 10x larger busy-compute (500M
iterations): **speedup *dropped* to 5.51x**, ruling out the initial stdout
contention hypothesis. The real cost is **per-branch dispatch overhead**
(~100ms per branch on this laptop), which is dominated by:

- **Thermal throttling on sustained all-cores load.** Laptop CPUs clock down
  when all 18 cores run at 100% for hundreds of milliseconds. Sequential
  keeps one core hot only — far less aggressive. Auto-par hammers all cores
  simultaneously → 2-3x effective per-core throughput drop.
- **L3 cache / memory bandwidth contention** at 18-core saturation.

At small N (≤18), each worker runs one branch and finishes before thermal
throttling fully engages → ~88% efficiency. At medium N (50-100), workers
sustain all-cores load just long enough to trigger throttling but not long
enough for busy-compute to dwarf the per-branch dispatch cost → efficiency
dips. At large N (200-500), busy-compute (28 branches/worker × 80ms) dwarfs
per-branch overhead → efficiency recovers.

**Implication: the 17x ceiling on this hardware is a laptop-thermal artifact,
not a runtime design limitation.** Server-class hardware with proper
cooling would push the curve closer to ideal across all N. Worth re-running
this benchmark on Linux server hardware once available; expected efficiency
band there is 90%+ across the full N range.

## Cumulative Cost Surface validation

`design.md § Performance Diagnostics > Cumulative Cost Surface` lists
five categories the `karac query cost-summary` JSON renderer reports
per-function and as totals: `rc_ops` (with `rc` / `arc` breakdown),
`arc_provider_wraps`, `borrow_flag_fields`, `partition_guard_sites`,
`auto_clone_insertions`. Observed counts on the Parallax-lite workload
(after `karac query cost-summary <concatenated workload>`):

| Category                | Per-function       | Total |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| `rc_ops.count`          | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `rc_ops.rc`             | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `rc_ops.arc`            | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `arc_provider_wraps`    | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `borrow_flag_fields`    | 0 (struct-level)   | 0     |
| `partition_guard_sites` | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `auto_clone_insertions` | 0 (every fn)       | 0     |
| `perf_notes`            | (none)             | 0     |
| `by_function`           | (empty)            | (n/a) |

All zeros. The surface is empty because the workload does not exercise
RC types (no `shared struct`), does not call `with_provider[R](...)`
in the entry point (deviation — see below), does not declare `mut`
fields on struct types (no borrow flags), does not partition Vec/Slice
in any flow (no partition guards), and has no auto-clone candidates
(no shared values consumed across multiple use sites). The structural
*shape* of the cost-summary output (totals object with the five
categories, `by_function` list, `perf_notes` list) matches the spec
table — `tests/parallax_lite.rs::test_parallax_lite_query_cost_summary_structural`
pins the shape against future regressions.

For v1.x cost-model tuning ground-truth this row of zeros is the
baseline: a workload that is purely auto-par-driven incurs no
cost-surface debt. Workloads that combine auto-par with RC/Arc
provider injection (the future canonical demo, once "Par codegen:
return values" closes the join-shape gap) will populate non-zero
counts and make the cost-model trade-offs visible.

- `kara.toml` — project manifest (`name = "parallax_lite"`, `edition =
  "2026"`, no dependencies).
- `src/resources.kara` — `MetricsRecorder` trait, three trait-bound
  effect resources (`MetricsA / MetricsB / MetricsC`), `InMemoryMetrics`
  provider impl with a CPU-bound busy-compute kernel.
- `src/workload.kara` — three driver functions (`record_a / record_b /
  record_c`) each carrying a distinct `writes(R_i)` effect, and the
  `process_request` aggregator whose three-statement body is the
  slice's load-bearing code.
- `src/main.kara` — entry point. Currently calls `process_request()`
  directly without the canonical nested `with_provider` dance, because
  v1 codegen does not yet wire trait-method dispatch inside a provider
  scope to the concrete impl (`db_pipeline/src/db.kara` GAP-N) — a
  `MetricsA.record(...)` call inside `with_provider[MetricsA](...)` is
  a no-op at runtime today. Auto-par lowering keys off the *effect
  annotations*, not provider availability, so the demo-shape's
  load-bearing piece (the analyzer's group decision and the codegen's
  `karac_par_run` dispatch) is unaffected by the deviation. Once
  GAP-N closes, `main.kara` can grow back the canonical
  `with_provider[MetricsA] -> with_provider[MetricsB] ->
  with_provider[MetricsC] -> process_request()` nesting.
