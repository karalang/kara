//! Per-type clone runtime helpers used by `emit_clone_fn_for_type_expr`.
//!
//! The codegen-emitted `karac_clone_<typename>` functions (one per type
//! mangled name, cached in the codegen `clone_fn_cache`) inline most of
//! their work: primitives are a load+store, Vec/Map/Set/Tuple recurse
//! through per-element clones synthesised in LLVM IR. The cases that
//! genuinely need a runtime helper are:
//!
//! * `String` — the codegen would otherwise have to duplicate the
//!   alloc-then-memcpy dance every emit site, including the static-
//!   literal `cap == 0` special case. One helper is cleaner.
//!
//! Future helpers (cycle-safe Rc clone, finalizer-aware refcounted clone)
//! land here too.

/// a fresh buffer holding `len` bytes, copies the source contents, and
/// writes `{new_data, len, new_cap}` to `*dst`.
///
/// Static-literal handling: when the source `cap == 0` (the convention for
/// strings whose buffer lives in the program's read-only string pool and
/// therefore must never be freed), the clone allocates a `len`-byte buffer
/// with `new_cap = len` so the cloned String's scope-exit cleanup correctly
/// frees it; the source's `cap = 0` keeps the static buffer untouched. For
/// already-heap-owned source strings (`cap > 0`), the clone's capacity
/// matches the source so a follow-up `push_str` in the cloned String has
/// the same headroom characteristic as a fresh copy.
///
/// Empty strings (`len == 0`) skip the allocation: the new String gets
/// `data = null`, `cap = 0`. The interpreter and codegen scope-exit free
/// paths already handle null-data Strings as no-ops.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// * `src` must point to a readable, fully-initialised `KaracString`.
/// * `dst` must point to a writable `KaracString`-sized region.
/// * The caller is responsible for the resulting String's lifetime —
///   typically registered with the codegen scope-cleanup machinery via
///   the same `track_vec_var` path Strings already use.
