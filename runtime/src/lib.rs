//! Kāra runtime library. Statically linked into every compiled Kāra binary.
//!
//! The compiler emits calls into this library for parallel execution, task
//! scheduling, and (eventually) event-loop integration and atomic primitives.
//! See design.md § Runtime Distribution.
//!
//! All public symbols are `extern "C"` — the compiler emits LLVM calls against
//! this ABI, so the surface must remain stable across compiler/runtime
//! versions built in lockstep and is NOT stable across independently built
//! pairs. Distribution is always compiler+runtime bundled.
//!
//! ## Debugger Contract (design.md § Debugger Contract)
//!
//! The four-piece contract surface that gives slice 5's
//! `std.runtime::list_par_blocks()` / `list_tasks()` / `has_debug_metadata()`
//! and the future `std.panic` crash-report `parallel_context` field a stable
//! shape to read against:
//!
//! 1. **`SpawnSiteId` metadata table** — `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES` /
//!    `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_LEN` / `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED` globals emitted
//!    by codegen (slice 3, `c6d8b44`). Per-binary stable IDs for every
//!    `par {}` block (explicit + inferred) joined to `(file, line, col)`.
//! 2. **Parent-frame reference on worker frames** — `KaracFrame::parent`
//!    (slice 4): every worker frame produced by `karac_par_run` carries a
//!    pointer back to the frame that created it; root tasks have `null`.
//!    Slice 5 walks this graph to reconstruct the structured-concurrency
//!    tree.
//! 3. **Await-chain pointer on suspended tasks** — `KaracFrame::wait_target`
//!    (slice 4 contract surface only; v1 always populates `KaracWaitTarget::None`).
//!    Real values land when Phase 6.3's network event loop ships and registers
//!    `WaitTarget`s at I/O-effect-boundary operations.
//! 4. **Crash-report `parallel_context` field** — co-developed with these
//!    globals, lands with `std.panic` (separate Phase 8 entry).

// ── Long-lived worker pool for `karac_par_run` ─────────────────────────────
//
// One global pool of N = `resolve_pool_workers()` worker threads,
// lazy-initialized on the first call to `karac_par_run`. The resolver
// honors `KARAC_PAR_WORKERS=N` for explicit override (down to 1) and
// falls back to `available_parallelism()` floored at 2 when unset. Replaces
// the original per-call `thread::scope` + `s.spawn` impl, which created
// fresh OS threads on every fan-out — diagnosed as the dominant Parallax
// bench bottleneck (60 % of CPU in `mach_vm_protect` setting up pthread
// stack guard pages, 3,344 unique TIDs in 30 s of recording at 1,090 req/s).
// See `docs/investigations/parallax_perf.md § Findings` for the profile
// data and `docs/implementation_checklist/phase-7-codegen.md § "karac_par_
// run: long-lived worker pool"` for the design record.
//
// **Per-call sync.** Each `karac_par_run` invocation allocates one
// `Arc<ParCall>` carrying the cancel flag, remaining-count, and
// completion `Condvar`. Tasks for the call are pushed to the global queue
// and pop'd by free workers; each task decrements `remaining` after
// running and the last task signals `notify`. The caller waits on
// `notify` until `remaining == 0` before returning — same semantics as
// the original `thread::scope` join.
//
// **Soundness for parent-stack pointers.** The original impl relied on
// Rust's `thread::scope` guarantee (parent stack outlives all scope-
// spawned children). The pool impl gives the same guarantee through a
// different mechanism: `karac_par_run` blocks on the per-call Condvar
// until every dispatched task has either run to completion or been
// skipped due to cancel, so the calling thread's stack frame —
// containing the captured `CURRENT_FRAME` pointer that becomes children's
// `parent` field — remains valid for the duration of the call.
//
// **Nested par + work-helping.** A pool worker can call `karac_par_run`
// recursively (e.g., one auto-par fan-out's branch contains another).
// Naively the worker would block on its child call's Condvar; if N
// workers all do this simultaneously the pool deadlocks (no free worker
// can pick up the dispatched child tasks). The wait loop in
// `karac_par_run` therefore work-helps: while waiting for completion it
// pops + executes any task on the queue. This bounds nested-par recursion
// only by stack depth, not by pool size. Cost: one extra queue-lock per
// wait iteration when no help is available — negligible vs the syscall
// cost the pool replaces.
//
// **No graceful shutdown.** Pool workers are pure-compute daemon threads;
// process exit cleans them up. Real shutdown lands when a destructor or
// test-teardown surface needs it.

/// Per-call shared state. One `Arc<ParCall>` per `karac_par_run` invocation;
/// shared between the calling thread and every dispatched task.
///
/// **Reused by `scheduler::karac_runtime_spawn` for fresh-task dispatch.**
/// Each `spawn()` call builds a 1-task `ParCall` (with `remaining = 1`,
/// `track_frames = false`, defaults elsewhere) and pushes one `Task` onto
/// the global `Pool`. The cancel + notify machinery is reused for the
/// spawn-side join wait. See `scheduler.rs` for the dispatch surface.

// ── Auto-par reduction: karac_par_reduce (slice 2, 2026-05-19) ─────────────
//
// Sibling to `karac_par_run`. Splits a single loop's iteration space across
// N workers, each accumulating into a private slot via the codegen-provided
// `worker_fn`; the runtime then runs a serial combine pass over the slots
// into a caller-owned `out_slot`. The recognizer that surfaces reductions
// lives in `src/concurrency.rs` (slice 1, `LoopReduction`); the codegen
// lowering that calls into this entry point lands as slice 3.
//
// **ABI shape (opaque slot bytes + caller-provided init/combine fn).**
// The runtime treats accumulator slots as `slot_size` bytes at `slot_align`
// alignment with no type knowledge. Typing flows through the three function
// pointers (`init_slot`, `worker_fn`, `combine_fn`) that codegen emits per
// accumulator type. A single `karac_par_reduce` symbol therefore covers
// every op × type combination in the allow-list without ABI growth — adding
// a new (op, type) pair only requires a new codegen path, not a new runtime
// entry point.
//
// **Identity-element discipline.** Reductions need an identity (0 for `+`,
// 1 for `*`, `!0` for `&`, 0 for `|`/`^`). Each worker's slot starts at
// identity (caller calls `init_slot`), then the worker_fn folds its range
// into the slot. The final serial combine seeds `out_slot` at identity and
// folds each worker slot in — so a 0-iter call returns identity, matching
// the source-level semantics of a 0-iter for-loop over the accumulator.
//
// **Dispatch path (slice 3b.7, 2026-05-20): shared `karac_par_run` pool.**
// Earlier (slice 2) each invocation spawned N OS threads via
// `thread::scope` and joined them on return. That worked for one-shot
// reductions but paid per-call thread-creation cost — kata-7 measured
// ~+0.3 MiB peak RSS on top of Rust's serial baseline from worker stack
// reservations alone. The pool-sharing refactor pushes reduction tasks
// onto the same `Pool { queue, cv }` that `karac_par_run` already
// drains via N long-lived workers. The Task struct was generalized to
// carry a `Box<dyn FnOnce(&AtomicBool) + Send>` instead of a fixed
// (func, ctx_addr) pair — the closure captures the (slot, start, end,
// ctx) tuple per worker. `karac_par_reduce` builds an `Arc<ParCall>`
// for the per-call cancel / remaining / notify barrier, pushes
// `n_workers` tasks, then runs the same wait-with-work-help loop as
// `karac_par_run` so nested-par-reduce-inside-par-block can't deadlock
// the pool. Per-call cost drops to one `Box` alloc per task (~hundreds
// of ns total for N=18 workers) vs the prior thread::scope's tens of
// µs spawn cost; peak RSS returns near parity with Rust.

/// Helper for sharing the pool dispatch + work-helping wait loop between
/// `karac_par_run` and `karac_par_reduce`. Pushes `tasks` onto the global

// `Runtime.list_tasks()` surface declared in `runtime/stdlib/runtime.kara`.
//
// **Linkage choice (cross-checked against `cat rust-toolchain.toml`).**
// The slice plan flagged a fork between `#[linkage = "extern_weak"]`
// (nightly-only via `#![feature(linkage)]`) and strong linkage on stable
// Rust. The project pins stable Rust (no `rust-toolchain.toml`; cargo
// 1.95.0 stable), so this section takes the **strong-linkage** path:
// slice 3's `emit_spawn_sites_metadata` always emits the globals (even
// the gate-off form ships `LEN = 0`, `ENABLED = false`, empty array), so
// extern declarations without `#[linkage]` resolve at link time on every
// karac binary. Hard-stop trigger 1 is satisfied: weak linkage is only
// needed when some build path skips the emission, which slice 3 never
// does.
//
// **Vec materialization (sub-step f, hard-stop trigger 3).** Slice 5 takes
// the runtime-side full Vec materialization path: `karac_runtime_list_par_blocks_into`
// allocates the `Vec[ParBlockInfo]` element buffer, populates each entry
// (including per-entry String allocation for the file-path field), and
// writes the final `{data, len, cap}` Vec descriptor into a slot the
// codegen alloca'd. Trade-off: the runtime carries Kāra Vec + String
// layout knowledge (already present from `clone.rs::karac_string_clone`)
// and the compiler-side ParBlockInfo struct layout (matched via `#[repr(C)]`
// with explicit padding). Codegen-side complexity drops from ~80 lines of
// inline-IR loop to a single call + load. The alternative (codegen emits
// the iteration + per-entry String clone in inline IR) is the
// plan-recommended path; slice 5 deviates because the Kāra-side `String`
// allocation surface for inline-IR construction (hard-stop trigger 4) is

// emitted by codegen carries a `provider_stack_head` snapshot from the
// calling thread; each worker calls `karac_provider_set_stack_head` from
// the branch fn prologue to seed its TLS.

// `Json.stringify(self) -> String` through a pair of `extern "C"` exports
// keyed against `serde_json` (locked design choice (iii) — backing impl is
// `serde_json` via Rust FFI, no hand-rolled Kāra parser).
//
// **Variant-payload-struct shape, not `#[repr(C)] union`.** Sub-step (d)'s
// hard-stop trigger 1 explicitly recommends starting with the variant-
// struct alternative because `#[repr(C)]` unions are unsafe-fiddly and
// every node carrying the largest payload size is negligible at the demo's
// typical tree size (~20 nodes ≈ ~320 bytes overhead). `KaracJsonValue`
// below is therefore one tag byte plus six payload fields, only one of
// which is meaningful per the tag.
//
// **Memory ownership.** Both `karac_runtime_json_parse` and
// `karac_runtime_json_stringify` allocate Boxed trees / `CString`s through
// the standard Rust allocator and return raw pointers; the matching
// `karac_runtime_json_free_value` and `karac_runtime_json_free_string`
// exports return that ownership for cleanup. The Kāra-side bindings in
// `runtime/stdlib/json.kara` walk the tree once into native `Json` shape
// (and once for stringify back), then free immediately — no aliased
// references survive past the round-trip.
//
// **Codegen wiring is deferred to a sibling slice.** v1's interpreter
// dispatch in `src/interpreter.rs` calls `serde_json` directly without
// crossing the FFI boundary; the runtime exports below exist so that when
// codegen wires in JSON support (Slice B's `Response.json[T: ToJson]`
// builder, deferred), the ABI is already settled. They are invoked by the
// `tests::test_json_*` runtime-crate tests at the bottom of this file to
// keep the surface live.

//
// Slice (1) of the `Json.stringify()` codegen entry in phase-8-stdlib-floor.md.
// The compiled-binary path to `j.stringify()` requires walking a Kāra-side
// `Json` enum value (variant-tagged `{ tag i64, w0 i64, w1 i64, w2 i64 }`)
// into a runtime-side `*mut KaracJsonValue` tree before handing the tree to
// `karac_runtime_json_stringify`. The walker itself is emitted on the codegen
// side (one synthesized LLVM helper `__karac_json_kara_to_ffi` per module);
// the helpers below are the primitive constructors it calls.
//
// Memory ownership rule matches the rest of the std.json surface: each
// constructor returns a freshly Boxed `KaracJsonValue` (or, for the buffer
// helpers, a freshly allocated `Vec<_>::into_raw` triple), and the caller
// owns the resulting allocation through to either `karac_runtime_json_*` or
// `karac_runtime_json_free_value`. Buffers allocated by `_alloc_*_buf` MUST
// be handed to the matching `_make_array` / `_make_object` consumer — those
// constructors capture the buffer for later free via `Vec::from_raw_parts`
// in `karac_runtime_json_free_value`'s Array/Object arms.

//         No client (the existing client surface in `runtime/stdlib/http.kara`
//         is a separate Phase 8 entry); no middleware / TLS / HTTP/2 /
//         WebSocket.
//   (ii)  B2 hyper backing through this FFI boundary; mirrors Slice F's
//         `serde_json` shape (variant-payload structs, raw-pointer ownership
//         routed back through `karac_runtime_*_free` exports).
//   (iii) B3 fallback (b) — non-polymorphic `serve(handler: fn(Request) -> Response)`
//         with effect-erasure at the FFI boundary. Effect-set parameter syntax
//         on free fns isn't typechecker-supported yet (Theme 6 settled the
//         trait-method shape but free-fn shape is the open delta); polymorphic
//         `serve[E]` is additive once that lands.
//   (iv)  B4 two-layer concurrency — hyper's `tokio::runtime::Runtime` (multi-
//         thread flavor) is built inside `karac_runtime_serve_http`; per-request
//         hyper invokes the Kāra handler synchronously through
//         `tokio::task::block_in_place`, so the handler can sleep / do
//         compute work without breaking the executor.
//   (v)   B5 one bound-zero-port smoke test — see `tests/http_server.rs`.

// The runtime crate's `cargo test -p karac-runtime` binary has its own
// (test-only) symbol space — the LLVM globals `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES`,
// `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_LEN`, `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED` emitted by codegen
// never enter the link. The `#[cfg(not(test))]` gate on the `extern "C"`
// block above means the runtime test binary has no extern decl to resolve
// — it instead reads the stand-in `static` definitions below directly.
//
// In real karac-build pipelines (compiler emits + runtime statically
// links), codegen's `emit_spawn_sites_metadata` provides the symbols with
// `External` linkage and the runtime's `extern "C"` block resolves to
// them. The two paths never collide because they're cfg-gated apart.
//
// `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED = 1` flips
// `karac_runtime_has_debug_metadata()` to `true` for the corresponding
// runtime test (`test_has_debug_metadata_reads_through_global`). `_LEN = 0`
// makes the `list_par_blocks_into` snapshot-from-table loop a no-op for
// tests that don't bind a real frame.
//
// `SpawnSiteEntryStandIn` wraps `KaracSpawnSiteEntry` so we can express
// `unsafe impl Sync` for the const-static stand-in (raw pointers are

mod tests {
    //! Runtime unit tests for the Debugger Contract slice 4 surface
    //! (parent-frame ref + `KaracWaitTarget`).
    //!
    //! **Frame-tracking test isolation.** Two distinct hazards force
    //! these tests to serialize on `FRAME_TRACKING_ENV_LOCK`:
    //!
    //! 1. **Env-var races on `KARAC_RUNTIME_DEBUG_METADATA`.** Cargo runs
    //!    tests in parallel, so any test that mutates the var races peers
    //!    reading it. Compounding this, `runtime_debug_metadata_enabled`
    //!    caches its result in a `OnceLock<bool>` — once initialized the
    //!    env read never repeats, so a test mutating the var after another
    //!    test has triggered initialization observes nothing.
    //! 2. **Shared-state races on `ACTIVE_FRAMES`.** The registry is a
    //!    process-global `static Mutex<Vec<FramePtr>>`, not thread-local.
    //!    Any test that pushes frames into it (directly via `FrameGuard`
    //!    or transitively by calling `karac_par_run`) or that reads it
    //!    (directly or via `karac_runtime_list_par_blocks_into` /
    //!    `karac_runtime_for_each_active_frame`) must hold the lock.
    //!    Without this, a reader test can run during another test's
    //!    barrier window and observe frames it shouldn't.
    //!
    //! Resolution: every frame-tracking test acquires
    //! `FRAME_TRACKING_ENV_LOCK` at entry, and the disabled-path test
    //! goes through `runtime_debug_metadata_enabled_uncached` (test-only
    //! re-read that bypasses the cache). This mirrors slice 3's
    //! `SPAWN_SITE_ENV_LOCK` pattern in `tests/codegen.rs`.
    //!
    //! Frame-pointer cross-thread shuttling uses `usize` casts so the
    //! `*const KaracFrame` (which is `!Send`) crosses the thread boundary
    //! as a plain integer; the runtime never relies on Rust's auto-Send
    //! inference for these pointers. Soundness now comes from
    //! `karac_par_run`'s per-call Condvar wait, which keeps the calling
    //! thread's frame alive until every dispatched task has finished —
    //! see `ParCall` doc-comments above.
