//! Kāra runtime library. Statically linked into every compiled Kāra binary.
//!
//! The compiler emits calls into this library for parallel execution, task
//! scheduling, and (eventually) event-loop integration and atomic primitives.
//! See design.md § Runtime Distribution.
//!
//! All public symbols are `extern "C"` — the compiler emits LLVM calls against
//! this ABI, so the surface must remain stable across compiler/runtime
//! versions built in lockstep and is NOT stable across independently built
//! pairs. Distribution is always compiler+runtime bundled.
//!
//! ## Debugger Contract (design.md § Debugger Contract)
//!
//! The four-piece contract surface that gives slice 5's
//! `std.runtime::list_par_blocks()` / `list_tasks()` / `has_debug_metadata()`
//! and the future `std.panic` crash-report `parallel_context` field a stable
//! shape to read against:
//!
//! 1. **`SpawnSiteId` metadata table** — `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES` /
//!    `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_LEN` / `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED` globals emitted
//!    by codegen (slice 3, `c6d8b44`). Per-binary stable IDs for every
//!    `par {}` block (explicit + inferred) joined to `(file, line, col)`.
//! 2. **Parent-frame reference on worker frames** — `KaracFrame::parent`
//!    (slice 4): every worker frame produced by `karac_par_run` carries a
//!    pointer back to the frame that created it; root tasks have `null`.
//!    Slice 5 walks this graph to reconstruct the structured-concurrency
//!    tree.
//! 3. **Await-chain pointer on suspended tasks** — `KaracFrame::wait_target`
//!    (slice 4 contract surface only; v1 always populates `KaracWaitTarget::None`).
//!    Real values land when Phase 6.3's network event loop ships and registers
//!    `WaitTarget`s at I/O-effect-boundary operations.
//! 4. **Crash-report `parallel_context` field** — co-developed with these
//!    globals, lands with `std.panic` (separate Phase 8 entry).

// ── Debugger Contract — `std.runtime` introspection (slice 5) ──────────────
//
// Item (4) of the four-piece contract per `design.md § Debugger Contract`.
// Materializes slice 3's `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES` LLVM globals + slice 4's
// `ACTIVE_FRAMES` registry as Kāra-callable APIs through the
// `Runtime.has_debug_metadata()` / `Runtime.list_par_blocks()` /
// `Runtime.list_tasks()` surface declared in `runtime/stdlib/runtime.kara`.
//
// **Linkage choice (cross-checked against `cat rust-toolchain.toml`).**
// The slice plan flagged a fork between `#[linkage = "extern_weak"]`
// (nightly-only via `#![feature(linkage)]`) and strong linkage on stable
// Rust. The project pins stable Rust (no `rust-toolchain.toml`; cargo
// 1.95.0 stable), so this section takes the **strong-linkage** path:
// slice 3's `emit_spawn_sites_metadata` always emits the globals (even
// the gate-off form ships `LEN = 0`, `ENABLED = false`, empty array), so
// extern declarations without `#[linkage]` resolve at link time on every
// karac binary. Hard-stop trigger 1 is satisfied: weak linkage is only
// needed when some build path skips the emission, which slice 3 never
// does.
//
// **Vec materialization (sub-step f, hard-stop trigger 3).** Slice 5 takes
// the runtime-side full Vec materialization path: `karac_runtime_list_par_blocks_into`
// allocates the `Vec[ParBlockInfo]` element buffer, populates each entry
// (including per-entry String allocation for the file-path field), and
// writes the final `{data, len, cap}` Vec descriptor into a slot the
// codegen alloca'd. Trade-off: the runtime carries Kāra Vec + String
// layout knowledge (already present from `clone.rs::karac_string_clone`)
// and the compiler-side ParBlockInfo struct layout (matched via `#[repr(C)]`
// with explicit padding). Codegen-side complexity drops from ~80 lines of
// inline-IR loop to a single call + load. The alternative (codegen emits
// the iteration + per-entry String clone in inline IR) is the
// plan-recommended path; slice 5 deviates because the Kāra-side `String`
// allocation surface for inline-IR construction (hard-stop trigger 4) is
// not directly exposed at the relevant abstraction level.

// Strong-linkage extern declarations of slice 3's globals. Gated on
// `#[cfg(not(test))]` so the runtime crate's own unit tests can provide
// stand-in definitions (see the `#[cfg(test)]` block at the bottom of
// this file) — codegen-emitted globals only enter the link in real karac

// (no par-block) have no `KaracFrame` — `karac_par_run` is the only site
// that allocates one. A thread-local works uniformly for root and spawned
// tasks; the per-`R.method()` cost is one TLS read, well within the cost
// model `design.md` already names ("thin Arc deref + one vtable
// indirection"). Cross-task inheritance (par-block branches): the env-struct
// emitted by codegen carries a `provider_stack_head` snapshot from the
// calling thread; each worker calls `karac_provider_set_stack_head` from
// the branch fn prologue to seed its TLS.
//
// **Frame ownership.** `ProviderFrame` storage is alloca'd by codegen at
// each `with_provider[R](p, ||body)` site; `karac_provider_push` populates
// the frame in-place and links it as the new head. `karac_provider_pop`

// `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_LEN`, `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED` emitted by codegen
// never enter the link. The `#[cfg(not(test))]` gate on the `extern "C"`
// block above means the runtime test binary has no extern decl to resolve
// — it instead reads the stand-in `static` definitions below directly.
//
// In real karac-build pipelines (compiler emits + runtime statically
// links), codegen's `emit_spawn_sites_metadata` provides the symbols with
// `External` linkage and the runtime's `extern "C"` block resolves to
// them. The two paths never collide because they're cfg-gated apart.
//
// `KARAC_SPAWN_SITES_ENABLED = 1` flips
// `karac_runtime_has_debug_metadata()` to `true` for the corresponding
// runtime test (`test_has_debug_metadata_reads_through_global`). `_LEN = 0`
// makes the `list_par_blocks_into` snapshot-from-table loop a no-op for
// tests that don't bind a real frame.
//
// `SpawnSiteEntryStandIn` wraps `KaracSpawnSiteEntry` so we can express

    //! **Frame-tracking test isolation.** Two distinct hazards force
    //! these tests to serialize on `FRAME_TRACKING_ENV_LOCK`:
    //!
    //! 1. **Env-var races on `KARAC_RUNTIME_DEBUG_METADATA`.** Cargo runs
    //!    tests in parallel, so any test that mutates the var races peers
    //!    reading it. Compounding this, `runtime_debug_metadata_enabled`
    //!    caches its result in a `OnceLock<bool>` — once initialized the
    //!    env read never repeats, so a test mutating the var after another
    //!    test has triggered initialization observes nothing.
    //! 2. **Shared-state races on `ACTIVE_FRAMES`.** The registry is a
    //!    process-global `static Mutex<Vec<FramePtr>>`, not thread-local.
    //!    Any test that pushes frames into it (directly via `FrameGuard`
    //!    or transitively by calling `karac_par_run`) or that reads it
    //!    (directly or via `karac_runtime_list_par_blocks_into` /
    //!    `karac_runtime_for_each_active_frame`) must hold the lock.
    //!    Without this, a reader test can run during another test's
    //!    barrier window and observe frames it shouldn't.
    //!
    //! Resolution: every frame-tracking test acquires
    //! `FRAME_TRACKING_ENV_LOCK` at entry, and the disabled-path test
    //! goes through `runtime_debug_metadata_enabled_uncached` (test-only
    //! re-read that bypasses the cache). This mirrors slice 3's
    //! `SPAWN_SITE_ENV_LOCK` pattern in `tests/codegen.rs`.
    //!
    //! Frame-pointer cross-thread shuttling uses `usize` casts so the
    //! `*const KaracFrame` (which is `!Send`) crosses the thread boundary
    //! as a plain integer; the runtime never relies on Rust's auto-Send
