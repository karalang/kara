//! Network event loop. Cross-platform abstraction over the OS-level
//! fd-readiness facilities — `epoll` on Linux, `kqueue` on macOS / BSD,
//! `IOCP` on Windows — via the `mio` crate.
//!
//! See `docs/design.md § Network Event Loop and State-Machine Transform`
//! and `docs/implementation_checklist/phase-6-runtime.md` line 15.
//!
//! ## v1 architectural commitments (per phase-6-runtime.md line 15)
//!
//! - **One event loop per process.** v1 runs exactly one loop; M2 / M3
//!   may shard across multiple loops to reach the 1M+ idle-connection
//!   target. The type is `Sync` — shared via `Arc<EventLoop>` from any
//!   thread — with two interior Mutexes that split the polling and
//!   registration code paths so a long-blocking `run_once` (held by
//!   the background poller thread, slice 3) does not block concurrent
//!   register / deregister calls.
//! - **Registration / de-registration are crate-internal.** The public
//!   language surface stays effect-typed (`sends(Network)` /
//!   `receives(Network)`); codegen lowers those effects into runtime
//!   calls. End-user Kāra code never sees this module's API.
//! - **Per-fd state holds the parked-task pointer + I/O direction +
//!   optional deadline.** Readiness wakeups carry the parked pointer
//!   back to the scheduler so it can resume the right task. The
//!   `deadline` field is stored so the timer-wheel work (M2 polish
//!   layer) can drive expiry-based wakeups without re-shaping the
//!   per-fd state.
//! - **Cross-thread wakeup via `mio::Waker`.** Under the hood `mio` uses
//!   `eventfd` on Linux, a pipe pair on BSD / macOS, and a posted IOCP
//!   completion packet on Windows — the three OS primitives the
//!   phase-6 entry calls out by name.

// ── Background event-loop poller + wakeup queue (Phase 6 line 17 slice 3) ──
//
// An opt-in background thread that owns event-loop polling. Once started,
// the thread loops on `EventLoop::run_once(None)` indefinitely (blocking
// in mio's poll inside the inner `poll` Mutex), depositing wakeups into
// an internal `VecDeque<KaracWakeup>` for consumption by a scheduler
// thread via `karac_runtime_event_loop_take_wakeups`.
//
// **No deadlock with registration.** The `EventLoop` refactor that
// landed alongside this section splits the inner state into two
// independent Mutexes — `poll` (held by the background thread for the
// duration of each blocking poll) and `fds` (held only briefly by
// register / deregister). Concurrent `karac_runtime_event_loop_register_fd`
// calls from any thread acquire only the `fds` Mutex, so the long-blocking
// poll does not stall registration.
//
// **Direct FFI poll coexistence.** While the background poller is running,
// direct `karac_runtime_event_loop_poll` callers short-circuit to return
// 0 immediately — the background poller has authoritative ownership of
// the polling channel and direct callers should drain via `take_wakeups`
// instead. Documented in `karac_runtime_event_loop_poll`'s body.
//
// **Shutdown protocol.** `karac_runtime_event_loop_shutdown_background_thread`
// sets the shutdown flag, fires the cross-thread `wake()` to unblock the
// current poll call, signals the queue's `Condvar` to release any
// waiting `take_wakeups` callers, joins the thread, and clears the
// global slot. Idempotent — calling on a non-running thread returns -1
// without side effects, so a re-start after shutdown is supported within
// the same process.

// ── Scheduler dispatcher (Phase 6 line 17 slice 4) ────────────────────────
//
// A background dispatcher thread that drains the background poller's
// wakeup queue and invokes `(task.poll_fn)(task.state, cancel)` on
// each wakeup. The `parked` field of each `KaracWakeup` is interpreted
// as `*const KaracParkedTask` — this is the convention that codegen
// (when state-machine lowering for network-boundary functions lands —
// phase-6 line 18) will follow when registering fds with the event
// loop.
//
// **Pairing with the background poller.** The dispatcher is opt-in
// and requires the background poller to be running. Calling
// `karac_runtime_scheduler_start_dispatcher` will auto-start the
// poller if it isn't already running — see the body.
//
// **Cancel routing.** v1 ships with a single process-global "never
// cancelled" `AtomicBool` that the dispatcher passes to each
// `poll_fn` invocation. Per-par-block cancel routing (so a parked
// task inside a fail-fast `par {}` observes its block's cancel flag)
// is later integration work — the FFI surface stays stable because
// the cancel pointer comes from the task's own state, not from the
// dispatcher's signature.
//
// **Lifetime convention.** The codegen is responsible for keeping the
// `KaracParkedTask` alive — and its `state` struct alive — from the
// `register_fd` call until `poll_fn` returns `Ready` or `Err`. The
// dispatcher does no allocation or freeing of task / state structs;
// it only invokes `poll_fn` through the type-erased pointers.
